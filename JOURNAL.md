# 16/06/2025 - The beginning
I started off by making a quick 10-minute brainstorm of how XYmatics-Alpha will work. Linear rails for Y-Axis, Linear rods for X-Axis, Prusa-XL-like toolchanging system. After spending 45 minutes in Fusion 360, I have designed the base frame. It consists of 4020 aluminium extrusions for the top and bottom, and 2020 for the vertical extrusions.

Total time - 55 minutes
