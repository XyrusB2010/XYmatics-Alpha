# 16/06/2025 - The beginning
I started off by making a quick 10-minute brainstorm of how XYmatics-Alpha will work. Linear rails for Y-Axis, Linear rods for X-Axis, Prusa-XL-like toolchanging system. After spending 45 minutes in Fusion 360, I have designed the base frame. It consists of 4020 aluminium extrusions for the top and bottom, and 2020 for the vertical extrusions. There are also a few corner brackets, but I will add more next time.

Total time - 55 minutes

# 17/06/2025 - Complete frame and start motion system
Finishing up the work from yesterday, I finished designing the brackets for the frame. These add extra reinforcement in the corners for stability. I began work on the motion system, and implemented the AB stepper motors and their mounts. The stepper motors I have used are two NEMA 17 42x34mms. I will aim to add more of the pulleys and idlers tomorrow.

Total time - 1 hour 45 minutes

# 26/06/2025 - Motion System Part Two
Excuse for the long wait. I did not have as much time to work on this project compared to last week. I have begun modelling the Linear Rails for the Y-Axis, as well as the carriage for mounting the X-Axis Linear Rods. For the Linear Rails, I have used two 430mm MGN12H rails, one on each side. The X-Axis uses two 8mm Linear Rods, which are secured with 4 M4 screws each. I just need to complete the rest of the pulley system for the XY axis to be finished.
